# To-Do-List
To Do Application
This is my study project. I have tried to write a To-Do list application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm only at the beginning of my programming journey, and I know that this project is very messy, but for the moment, I was trying to follow the rule: "Write a lot of code, even if it's bad."
